# ðŸš€ Backend Class Series

Welcome to my **Backend Development Learning Series**! ðŸŽ¯  
This repository is a **step-by-step journey** documenting everything I learn while diving deep into the world of backend engineering.  
My goal is not just to understand *how* things work, but also *why* they work the way they do â€” with hands-on examples, best practices, and real-world project insights.  

Whether you're a beginner exploring backend for the first time or someone brushing up your skills, this series will walk you through the **foundations of backend development all the way to deployment**.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered  

Each topic is broken down into clear lessons with explanations, sample code, and mini-projects:  

- âœ… **JavaScript Fundamentals for Backend**  
  Master the essential JS concepts like callbacks, promises, async/await, and module systems that power backend logic.  

- âœ… **Introduction to Node.js & Express.js**  
  Learn how Node.js works under the hood, and use Express.js to build scalable server applications.  

- âœ… **Building REST APIs (CRUD Operations)**  
  Step-by-step creation of APIs with Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality. Includes routes, controllers, and testing endpoints.  

- âœ… **Connecting to Databases (MongoDB & PostgreSQL)**  
  Explore both NoSQL and SQL databases, their differences, and how to integrate them into Node.js apps using drivers and ORMs.  

- âœ… **Authentication & Authorization**  
  Implement user login, JWT tokens, sessions, role-based access, and secure password handling.  

- âœ… **Error Handling & Middleware**  
  Learn how to catch bugs gracefully and write reusable middleware for logging, validation, and more.  

- âœ… **Advanced Routing & Project Structuring**  
  Move from simple projects to enterprise-grade architecture with modular routes, services, and MVC-like patterns.
